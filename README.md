## Key Differences
There are more counts of both precipitation and temperature for June relative to December which may mean the June data is more accurate. On average, there is more rain and lower temperatures in December, making it a less favourable time for a surf and ice cream shop. The standard deviations for June precipitation and temperature data is lower than December's, meaning the June data points falls closer to the average, making the average more representative of the data as a whole. 

# Recommendations for further analysis.
1. Rather than considering all precipitation and temperature across all years and all stations for the months of June and December, I would dive deeper by comparing the data by for the two months by specific years and specific stations. 

2. Since W. Avy is interested in expanding past Oahu, I would consider data for other islands in Hawaii for the purpose of analysis. 

3. I recommend also considering wave size for further data analysis. Higher and more frequent waves would mean increased traffic of surfers going out to catch some waves, and they will need a service shop.
